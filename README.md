# BridgeSystemCollector
A simple webapp for bridge players that allows to save their auction systems online, edit them and share with others

In order to run the code on Your computer as a local server (idk why You would be willing to do so but ok) You first
need to install the necessary node modules. To do so, assuming you have node.js (v8+) on Your computer, clone the repository
to a local directory of Your choice and navigate to it in the console. Then type in:

npm install

this will do the installation process for You. To run the app, just enter:

node server.js

The app will then run on port 3000.
